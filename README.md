# ECE484-PRJ-PIRSENSOR

This is the repo of my ECE 484 Midterm chip interface. My chip is the HC-SR501 PIR sensor. The intention of this repo is to create a simple motion detection alarm system. The repo consists of a variety of files. All files' content and interoperibility are described in the wiki.

To properly run:
1.) Build IC
2.) cd to proper path on your device that holds files
3.) upload code to arduino
3a.) Ensure within compile script that com port and directories are properly set up
3b.) Run command py compile_script.py 4 in command line while in proper directory
4.) Confirm upload success with command line output
5.) Test functionality
